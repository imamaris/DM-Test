1. Salmon (25.8%): Salmon is a product with the highest percentage of gross profit. This product has the greatest contribution to Aruna's profits, so I recommend this product as a top priority.
2. Salmon whole frozen (18%): Salmon whole frozen also has a significant percentage of gross profit. This product should be prioritized as the second most important product.
3. Dori (12.4%): Dori is the next product with a fairly high percentage of gross profit. This product needs to be considered and prioritized because of its contribution to the company's profits.
4. Dori BL Glazingan 50% (10.1%): Dori BL Glazingan has a significant percentage of gross profit. This product should be the fourth priority in the company's strategy.
